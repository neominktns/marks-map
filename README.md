There are four kinds of marks
Moles –  My parents gave me my moles. They are placed in the most arbitrary places, and they are there because it’s my nature. 
Scars - I gained them from my past experiences. Each experience caused me to bruise, bleed, cry, and grow. The injuries made part of me fall out, mend the gap with a scab and fill it with new flesh. 
My mom and dad were sad every time I was hurt and gained a new scar, but to me they are the symbols of my growth. 
Piercings - I did this to myself. I made holes on my completely fine ears because I wanted to. This was the first thing that was semi-permanently self-damaging my body to express myself. 
My parents know about this and they don’t say much. Unless they are branching out from my ears. 
Tattoos - I also did this to myself. But my parents will never know. 
I actually got caught by my mom. But my dad will never know about this until the day I die. 


My marks are my identifiers. Each of them underlies love, stories, growth and histories and composes the person I am. No one will ever have exactly the same composition of marks as I have and every composition of each individual is precious.
